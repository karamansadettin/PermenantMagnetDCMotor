# PermenantMagnetDCMotor
This is a mathematical representation of a(?) Permenant Magnet DC Motor, not a functional one or existing one.
Actually it is an overly simplified mathematical model explaining what happens in magnetic domain, so that one would be possible.

Calculations, discussion and further details are available in the .pdf and .pptx file.

Results of the script, depending on the parameters selected, are heatmaps presenting magnetic field pulling conductor loops towards to magnets, 
causing conductor loops to rotate, or a scalar entity, which looks like,
